  <p>D. Brumbley is the publishing pseudonym for the wife/husband duo of Dawn and Dave Brumbley. We figured hey, we write these books together, we do just about everything else together, and the pen name seemed pretty convenient, so we ran with it.</p>

  <h3>What We Write</h3>
  <p>You may have noticed, we get around to a few different genres, and we're not against opening that up even further in the future. Primarily, our books deal with a version of our world in which something, somewhere, is very different. Sometimes that something is that there are actually werewolves living behind everything else, sometimes it's because there's a near-omnipotent Voice granting deals to those who bear its mark, and sometimes it's because the story is set in a future where humanity is trying to colonize a new planet because they screwed this one up. In the future, who knows? There might be dragons. (There will definitely be dragons)</p>

  <h3>About the Work</h3>
  <p>We're firm believers in the notion that everything in this world revolves around people's relationships with each other. To that end, everything we write, whether it's sci-fi, paranormal, fantasy, whether it has scales or fur or laser pistols, it's about those connections. We want you to see our worlds through these peoples' eyes, fall in love the way they do, and feel the love their partners have for them. If we've done that, we've done everything we ever wanted with our stories.</p>
