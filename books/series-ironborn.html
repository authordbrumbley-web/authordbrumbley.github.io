    <p class="series-summary">Aura and Nick were born to bring legitimacy to the Ironborn wolves of Europe, but when the day came for them to be mated, Aura ran. Now years later, Nick has finally found her, to try and convince her to carry out their birthright. But the ruling council of Europe has other plans, and sets its sights on destroying their pack rather than granting the legitimacy they have earned.</p>

<p>Sometimes destiny finds you. Sometimes you’re born into it. And sometimes you run.</p>
<p>Aura is an Ironborn werewolf born into a privileged life as a young female raised to be a leader, a Mate, and to bring legitimacy of their kind to the werewolf Council that exists in secret away from humankind. Werewolves strengthened and powered by the natural elements they wield, Air, Fire, Water, among others rule the world under humanity’s nose; and Iron has never held a place of influence. </p>
<p>Now Aura is responsible to bear that power and expectation alongside her best friend, Nick, as his wife and Mate. It’s a life that is not her own, and a life she must abandon or let it consume her.</p>
<p>Sometimes lies obscure the truth. Sometimes hope is not reality. And sometimes you fight anyway. </p>
<p>Nickel has always known what his life would be, and stepped into the expectation that he would rule the Ironborn wolves into legitimacy for their kind. His family prepared the way. Generations prepared the way. Aura would be by his side. </p>
<p>The Council had other ideas.</p> 
<p>Aura had other ideas. </p>
<p>And a demon of wolfkind, a legend, a pariah, a danger to them all... might change everything.</p>

<p>Everything has changed.</p>
<p>Aura prepared herself to stand before the Council and was denied. She prepared to give her heart to the storm, and one electrical connection changed it all.</p>
<p>Where does that leave her? Her heart hanging in the balance, her home will prepare for war. But what is left for Aura, and most importantly, will Nick ever forgive her?</p>
<p>Nick put his life on the line, his heart, his reputation. Now they can never go back, and there is no escaping what must be done. The Ironborn must fight for their rightful place, but Nick has never felt so utterly alone. There is one who would claim his heart, one who promises the world, and Aura who left his heart in pieces in the hollow of his chest.</p>
<p>Everything has changed. And there is no going back.</p>

<p>It's been half a year since anyone has seen Orlando alive, but the old Council continues to antagonize the new, challenging their growing influence across Europe.</p>
<p>With hearts both broken by the war, Nick and Aura continue to search for their Shadowborn friend, seeking the end of the war and the peace for their people they've always craved. Candra, inexperienced as she is, takes the first steps on her own path for the first time in her life, willing to face any hazard to find and save her Shadowborn lover.</p>
<p>The war will uncover secrets, test loyalties, and force Orlando and Candra to discover the unknown limits of their godlike abilities. Nick and Aura will find victory or they will pay with their lives.</p>
<p>When the smoke clears, the wolves of Europe will have new masters, for better or for worse.      </li>    </p>
