<p>Magic does not care about right or wrong, good or evil, better or worse.</p>
<p>A pact does not care about individuals or nations.</p>
<p>The Voice only cares about Balance.</p>
<p>When she took the Mark, Molly only wanted to better herself with it, to make herself into the person she had always wanted to be. But every change the Voice granted her came with a cost, all piling up to make her just as much a mess as she always saw herself.</p>
<p>When the Voice eventually offered to remake her completely, it was a prize too good for her to pass up, but it cost her everything. Her love. Her life.</p>
<p>Molly, now Aimee, left behind everything she once knew. Now she has to find her place in a new life, in a new city. With the Vegas Covenant trying to recruit her on the one hand, and an order of zealots known as Hunters trying to kill her for being Marked. The only person left on her side is Cody, a sexy bouncer, who knows nothing about her magic or where she came from.</p>
<p>The more dangerous her life becomes, the tighter Cody holds on, rushing with her headlong into danger. There's no telling what is on the other side.</p>

<p>Time is a fickle thing, and is always bought with a cost. Time well spent, time well lived, time appreciated or lost. For someone who has lived beyond all modern understanding of time, the price of time is at a premium.</p>
<p>Sophia is a beautiful and ruthless businesswoman, a leader of the powerful Las Vegas Covenant. She and her brother lead with precision and fear, and Sophia has suffered love and loss too many times to count. Being close to Sophia comes at a price those around her never know until it is too late.</p>
<p>Enter Zeke. As the Vegas Covenant's resident hacker, surveillance, and know-it-all for over a decade, the Covenant loves to hate him. Somehow, though, romance finds a way.</p>
<p>The cost to Zeke and the covenant, though, might be deadly, especially when a new duo of Hunters comes into town, this time with a vendetta for the timeless Sophia.</p>
<p>Travis and Cassandra have a long history hunting the Marked, and a long history working together side by side. Travis is utterly devoted to their cause, and Cassandra is devoted to Travis.</p>
<p>Even if it means killing someone magical to prove her passion.</p>
<p>With the Voice behind the magic, someone always pays a price.</p>
