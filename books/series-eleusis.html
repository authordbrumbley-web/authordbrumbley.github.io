<p>A dying Earth.</p>
<p>A clean slate.</p>
<p>A stranger who might be everything you never dared to need.</p>
<p>The Eleusis Initiative promises humanity a second chance - on a distant world untouched by war, pollution, or history. But the cost of entry is high, and the truth behind the project is carefully hidden.</p>
<p>For Anna Prince and Logan Bickford, lifelong friends suspicious of all things Orbit-made, the decision to leave Earth means more than survival. It means confronting the feelings they've buried - and the lives they'll have to give up.</p>
<p>In orbit, Dr. Mercury Finnegan and Lieutenant Orion Al-Jabbar have trained for this all their lives. Newly matched, their connection burns fast and hot - but they must wrestle together with the possibility that the Initiative is not all that it promised.</p>
<p>As launch day approaches, four lives collide across the skies - testing loyalties, awakening desire, and challenging everything they thought they believed.</p>
<p>Eleusis is the future.</p>
<p>But paradise always comes at a price.</p>

<p>The Initiative is a trap.</p>
<p>Its leaders are liars.</p>
<p>And the road to Eleusis is nothing like what was promised.</p>
<p>After being forcibly cross-matched with one another’s spouses, Anna, Logan, Orion, and Mercury find themselves navigating systems of abuse and control, resisting the edicts of the Initiative while trying to survive its tightening grip. But as consequences mount, each must decide how far they're willing to go—and how much they’re willing to lose—for freedom.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the station set aside for the Initiative, Aiko Tanaka fights to save her brother Kazuo’s life. With their assigned partners, Carl Espinoza and Kameron Fitch, pressing Initiative leaders for help, time is running out—and drastic measures may be required.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gordon and Jessie dig into the mystery that brought Gordon to the Initiative in the first place, uncovering secrets the Consortium has buried—secrets that could upend everything humanity believes about its potential reach among the stars.</p>
<p>As the truth comes to light, everyone must choose:</p>
<p>Comply, and survive a lie.</p>
<p>Or rebel, and risk everything for the chance to build a future worth seeing.</p>

<p>The Consortium slaughters rebels daily.</p>
<p>The Twist has been taken—but still will not open.</p>
<p>How do you build a future when destruction is always one step behind?</p>
<p>After the fall of Station Nine, the rebellion vanishes underground. With Logan at the helm and help from Earthbound resistance leaders, the survivors take refuge in a hidden bunker deep in the Rocky Mountains. But more than a year has passed since their escape—and the Twist, their only path to Eleusis, remains sealed.</p>
<p>Freedom was never going to be simple.</p>
<p>Packed into tight quarters, the rebels face new challenges: rising tensions, buried desires, growing families, and unrelenting fear. Anna and Logan feel the pull of home. Mercury and Orion stare upward toward the one they lost. As the rebels gather strength and numbers, new recruits bring fresh hope—and dangerous secrets.</p>
<p>The time for hiding is ending.</p>
<p>The revolution is coming</p>
<p>But as pressure mounts, the question grows louder:</p>
<p>Will the dream of Eleusis survive the war it demands?</p>

<p>The Twists are gone.</p>
<p>The children are hostages.</p>
<p>Eleusis may be lost—forever.</p>
<p>On Earth, Logan scrambles to gather the shattered pieces of the rebellion. As the Consortium wages open war on every nation that dared support the uprising, cities burn and hope fails.</p>
<p>In Orbit, Mercury and hundreds of rebel prisoners cling to their humanity. Day by day, they walk the knife-edge between survival and defiance—parents, prisoners, and pawns in a war they cannot escape.</p>
<p>On Eleusis, Orion fights a dwindling war of attrition, pressing the last resistance against the walls of the Consortium compound. Inside those walls, Anna endures a hell beyond imagining.</p>
<p>They are scattered. Wounded. Stranded across two worlds and the space between.</p>
<p>But still they fight. Because love and desperation leave no other choice.</p>
<p>The darkest hours forge the deepest bonds.</p>
<p>Who do you cling to when all seems lost?</p>
